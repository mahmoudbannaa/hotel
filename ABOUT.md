, also JAVA 8 is now functional and reactive.

Nothing says long-lasting like being found everywhere, and that’s Java’s greatest asset.
also there is many many platforms and framework built on top of java from web applications , ORM ,
telecommunications , mobile , BPM , distributed applications , so Java used anywhere 
and everywhere.

with very wide range of groups and supports so if any problem happen we can easly search and find solutions 

# NodeJS and Angular
Used for developing single page front end app connect to RESTfull backend API
,Angular very useful and its syntax very simple , also its Arch depnend on dependincy injection that make
it very elegant and structured 

NodeJS is very powerful tool  to build front and backend application, I use it as to build fornt end App


#My Note
I try to build simple application , just to show how to consume API and create RESTfull
API using Java and spring boot framework 

- Application missing alot of things like Auth and Security and its not a production ready
- Front end need more 
- I add health check API to check if the app is up and running 
- Also it simple app so in my opinion its didn't required to make reactive or to be more complecated
